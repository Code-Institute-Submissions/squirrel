# squirrel

Squirrel is an application that allows users to log reviews and ratings of products, places, restaurants, movies, songs, or anything they would wish to keep track of.
It is not meant to be a social application, but a repository of likes and dislikes for the user's future reference. Each entry can be tagged and starred to be made easily searchable, and also updated or deleted.
